            <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. The building is one of several Canberra examples of this style, along with other major Canberra buildings including: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia. Churchill House is one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use. The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles. Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
